Once we had a structured plan, we conducted a deep-dive analysis to identify security gaps across Microsoft Azure.
# Findings & Identified Gaps:

Identity & Access Management Issues: Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and improper role-based access controls (RBAC).

Data Encryption Deficiencies: Some data stores lacked encryption at rest and encryption in transit.

Logging & Monitoring Gaps: Insufficient centralized logging, making security incidents harder to detect.

 Incident Response Limitations: Lack of formalized incident detection and response processes.
 
 Policy & Compliance Enforcement: Missing Azure Policies to enforce security best practices.
