## Compliance-Gap-Analysis-Security-Implementation-in-Microsoft-Azure
# Overview

When I started my role, one of my first major initiatives was conducting a compliance gap analysis to help the organization align with HIPAA and NIST 800-171 security standards. Working closely with the Executive Team and CISO, I led the effort to identify security gaps, implement necessary controls, and improve overall compliance scores within Microsoft Azure.

This project required a cross-functional approach, working with teams such as Development, IT, Infrastructure, Project Management, and Customer Service to ensure security controls were effectively implemented across the organization.

By the end of the project, we successfully increased our HIPAA & NIST 800-171 compliance scores from 25 to 89, significantly improving the organizationâ€™s security posture
